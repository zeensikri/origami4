        <li>Interesting Facts about Pandas</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.</li>
            <li>Pandas are BIG eaters â€“ every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to eat bamboo!</li>
            <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up.</li>
